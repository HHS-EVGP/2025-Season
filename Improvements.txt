Joshua's Thoughts part 2 *^*
Possible Improvements: (My Ideas for the Season)

New Features:
  -Add IMU (Gps, Accelerometer, Compass, and Gyroscope) Telemetry

    *NOOOOOOOO--- It is a good idea, but we moved away from an IMU last year due to having no use for it. 
     The car shakes so much, and the IMU's we have are kinda mid, that the data was usless, and was 
     really heavy. It used up most of the airspace when transmitting the data.*
    ^Okay, what if we just did GPS data? Longitude and Latitude would be usefull
      for putting all the data in context, and we could roughly calculate the rest from that. 
      Correct me if im wrong, but two more coollums, (be it large ones) does not seem that heavy to add.
      Even it is too hveavy, it would still be usefull to stash the data with timestamps locally on the car and then look at it later.^
    *^* Ooooooooo. I like this idea. And yes, two more coollums are not that bad, but IMU data is ~6-7 chr per axis, so about 40 chr with
       IMU data, which is why we movved away from it. As for GPS, I love it. The issue with sending the GPS data live time is 
       38.457059, -78.924718 that many chrs, so not that bad. But do we need it in real time? That I just don't know. (But yes, we should
       add it to the car!) *^*

  -Calculate optimal throttle for efficiency based on current telemetry.

    *Yes, as long as the drives can't see it.*
    ^Now that I think about it yes, real time throttle optimazations could be dangerously distracting,
      but it would still be helpfull to do something like optimal lap time, wich could be track specific. (and not viewed by drivers of course)^
    *^* Yes we need to do that *^*

  -New display for drivers (to relay this information)

    *We could, but we have found that the drivers really need to focus more on the race, and not on the data,
     We have people on the sidelines that can look at the data and relay it back to them over the phone. 
     When the drivers look at the data, they try and correct on their own, but sometimes we need them to 
     do things other than what the data is sayting, and so we want to interpret the data better.*
    ^That is Fair^
  
  -New Visualization UI (Not going to lie the current one is good but kind of hard to read)

    *In what ways is it hard? If you want to redo it, by all means go for it, but I have no iterset in redoing 
     it for a 4th time lol*
    ^It is not that hard, but I feel like improvements could be made to how easy the data is to read
     by just glancinig at it.^

  -After Race data Visualizer (map, replay, etc)
    *Might be cool, seems like a lot of work*
    ^I'll see if I have time (these optmmistic freshmen)^
    *^* Trust me, that would be AWESOME, but I have no idea where to start lol *^*

  -Virtual Machine images of pis or Virtual development environments for debugging code

    *VM on a pi that is in the feild seems scary to me... Plus we are using the PI's GPIO and that seems like a hassle
     to pass into a VM. Not saying its bad, but I don't know how to do it.*
    ^I was taking a look into a QEMU enviroment the other day, and there is some hastle but it seems promising
     enugh to pay off. The GIPO pins can be emulated, but we could not get any "data" from them^ 
    *^* I have never heard of QEMU before, I will have to look into it. As long as we can use the GPIO, that sounds cool.
        I just do not want to have to fight to get GPIO working, because we really need it *^*

  -Have pi automatically sync the repository on startup (Then we would want to use stable and development branches)

    *I don't know if that is a good idea or not. The reason I say that is due to the schools stupid WiFi policies, 
     The PI can not access GitHub or any repos to pull down to, so it makes it really hard to do that. I also do not know
     if it is worth the hassle. Might be nice*
    ^Agreed, Ill take a look^

Clean code:
  -Consistent formatting and commenting
    *HA! Would be very nice, I tried to clean it all up, but I am sure I missed some things*

  -Use names like, datawriter.py instead of main.py (we Currently have multiple main.py and index.html files)

    *For the python files that is fine, (We would need to make sure that they are being called by the new names then)
     But for the index.html, you can't change its name. Being index.html means that you don't have to go to site.com/page.html, 
     you can jsut go to site.com and it automatically goes to index.html.*
     ^Forgot about the index.html... But In general, our file organization could be more commprehensive.^
