Since I don't pay for fancy github, the large machine files are stored here:

You have to have a HCPS email to acces this, since the shool gives us unlimited storage. I might change its accesablility in the future, but the enviroment is going to be specific for our team's car, so I do not see much need for anyone else to use it.

YOU NEED versatile-pb-bullseye-5.10.63.dtb, rpilite.qcow2, AND kernel-qemu-5.10.63-bullseye IN THIS FOLDER for it to run.

-------------------

This is a QEMU emulaton enviroment to try and make it possible to run and debug the code we are writing for raspbery pis on x64 computers.
IT DOES NOT WORK YET! I can get it to boot, but not to login. Please give me a day or two (Or maybe a few months, im busy).

Prerequisites:
    qemu-system-arm (I am using version 1:8.2.2+ds-0ubuntu1.2)
    Sorry Windows users, you will have to figure that one out on your own...

To give it a go, boot it by executing the startup.sh script. (Sorry again Windows users. The script is just the startup command with a bunch of arguments so you could probably figure it out.)
Be warned, the virtual disk is currently full, so don't try to run anything on it yet.
