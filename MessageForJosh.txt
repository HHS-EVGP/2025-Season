Hello Josh (or anyone really), Welcome to my branch! Here is my plan:

Using a CSV to store and transmit our data is not the best option. If we used a database, we could have way more bandwidth available in transmission, alongside having our data be WAY EASIER TO MANAGE. After all, this is exactly what SQL is designed for.

Instead of using a CSV and transmitting UNICODE characters, we could transmit rows of an SQLite database as binary data. For every character we would be transmitting as Unicode, we could transmit any 32 bit number using the same amount of space. For example, the school ID (currently HHS) takes 6 bytes of data to be stored/transmitted. With that same amount of bandwidth, our school ID could be 123 (or any number under 256) and take only 1 byte. That leaves us with 5 BYTES LEFT OVER, which is enough in and of itself to transmit all the GPS data we would need to. If we did that with all our data, which is numerical in the first place, our current issues with bandwidth would be solved.

Using a database would also make organizing accumulated data way EASIER. A single database can hold as many tables as desired, meaning different teams, and different days, could have different tables. SQL also makes it incredibly EASIER to search and modify our data as needed.

One possible issue with using multiple tables would be that if multiple cars were transmitting data, it would be confused. This could easily be solved by adding a identification header to each transmission (Replacing the School ID) with we would have room for in our bandwidth.

Here is some documentation for stuff I am going to use:

SQLite: www.sqlite.org/index.html
Python Library: docs.python.org/3/library/sqlite3.html
Database browser (very helpful): sqlitebrowser.org

I would still like to meet with you in person to discuss what you are doing with the GPS, and make sure we are both on the same page moving forward.

Until I see you, Merry Christmas!
