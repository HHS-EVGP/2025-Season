Hello Josh (or anyone really), Welcome to my branch! Here is my plan:

Using a CSV to store and transmit our data is not the best option. If we used a database, and explored other radio protocols, we could have way more bandwidth available in transmission, alongside having our data be WAY EASIER TO MANAGE. After all, this is exactly what SQL is designed for.

I was mistaken about the argument for transmission bandwidth that was here... ASCII characters in utf-8 take only one byte. It is only the weird characters, such as emojis or cuneiform characters, that take four bytes. Using Unicode would be more reliable, and overall easier since that is how the data is reported by the sensors in the first place. I think that a lack of bandwidth could be solved by exploring other radio protocols. Having one kilobyte of data transfer per second is not that hard.

Using a database would also make organizing accumulated data way EASIER. A single database can hold as many tables as desired, meaning different teams, and different days, could have different tables. SQL also makes it incredibly EASIER to search and modify our data as needed.

One possible issue with using multiple tables would be that if multiple cars were transmitting data, it would be confused. This could easily be solved by adding a identification header to each transmission (Replacing the School ID), that the base station would use to sort the data.

Here is some documentation for stuff I am going to use:

SQLite: www.sqlite.org/index.html
Python Library: docs.python.org/3/library/sqlite3.html
Database browser (very helpful): sqlitebrowser.org

I would still like to meet with you in person to discuss what you are doing with the GPS, make sure we are both on the same page moving forward, and definatly discuss radio protocols.
