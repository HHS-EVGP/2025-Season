Possible Improvements: (My Ideas for the Season)

New Features:
  -Add IMU (Gps, Accelerometer, Compass, and Gyroscope) Telemetry
  -Calculate optimal throttle for efficiency based on current telemetry.
  -New display for drivers (to relay this information)
  
  -New Visualization UI (Not going to lie the current one is good but kind of hard to read)
  -After Race data Visualizer (map, replay, etc)

  -Virtual Machine images of pis or Virtual development environments for debugging code
  -Have pi automatically sync the repository on startup (Then we would want to use stable and development branches)


Clean code:
  -Consistent formatting and commenting
  -Use names like, datawriter.py instead of main.py (we Currently have multiple main.py and index.html files)
