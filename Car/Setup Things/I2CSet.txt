This file sets the I2C address of the SC18IM704 (UART to I2C-bus bridge)
Make sure that only ONE of the '704s are installed, and nothing else is online. 

I2C address of other things:
  # 0x4A Analog to Digital A
  # 0x4B Analog to Digital B
  # 0x6A IMU

Defult '704 I2C address is (usually): 0x28

Use a arduino to send the UART commands.

From CHATGPT:

Yes, the I2C address of the SC18IM704 can be set or changed, but this needs to be done through an internal register. According to the datasheet, the SC18IM704 allows you to configure the I2C address through an ASCII command sent via UART.

Here’s the process:

Default I2C Address:
By default, the SC18IM704 comes with a pre-defined I2C address (usually 0x28).
Changing the I2C Address:
To change the I2C address, you will need to use the write internal register command over UART. Here’s the general format:

Command to write to a register:
The format to write to the internal registers is:

php
Copy code
W <register address> <data>
Register for I2C Address:
The I2C address is stored in an internal register, and you need to update it with your desired value. The I2C address is typically stored in register 0x01, and you can set a new address in this register.

Example Command:
To set the I2C address to 0x30, send the following command to the SC18IM704 over UART:

Copy code
W 01 30
This will change the I2C address to 0x30. After setting the new address, you can communicate with the SC18IM704 using the updated I2C address.

Important Notes:
The I2C address should always be a valid 7-bit address.
Ensure that there are no conflicts with other devices on the same I2C bus when assigning the address.
Let me know if you need help with sending these commands or implementing this in code!
