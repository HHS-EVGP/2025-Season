## EV Data Collection and Visualization System

This project is a data collection and visualization system for an Electric Vehicle (EV) using a two Raspberry Pis and a CC1101 Radio module. The pi collects data, logs it, and transmits it to a pit station. The station stores the data in an sqlite database, and visualizes it through a web interface.

### Documentation coming soon!
